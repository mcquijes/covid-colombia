# covid-colombia

A [data analysis project](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/55d7d59d-f970-496f-b64d-2561132c9e4f/page/yHXCC) focused on analyzing daily cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccines rates in Colombia. These are the datasets that are pulled in real time for an accurate analysis:

**Data APIs**

1. Worldwide cases https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#00030720-fae3-4c72-8aea-ad01ba17adf8
2. Cases in Colombia https://www.datos.gov.co/resource/gt2j-8ykr.json, https://api.covid19api.com/dayone/country/colombia

You can also copy the [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QmFRCuoxrB59-I3N7c-JMt28WWcALhCk8xEXWl_u_5s/edit?usp=sharing) where I am storing most of the data that was gathered for the analysis (expect for the daily cases in Colombia, which is a large file). It will come with a custom script that will pull the data and refresh it, but you need to set up the trigger yourself for it to work.
